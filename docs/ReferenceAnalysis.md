# Reference Analysis

## Reference

Rimal Marine (`rimalmarine.ae`) was reviewed on 2026-07-14 as a functional reference only. This project must use original copy, visual design, assets, data, and implementation.

## Business and catalog scope

The reference is a UAE-based marine and boat spare-parts storefront. Its catalog is technical and deeply categorized: lighting, electricals, wiring, plumbing, toilet systems, deck hardware, cleaning/maintenance, anchoring/mooring, electronics, safety, navigation, ropes, and fuel systems.

## Customer flow

1. Browse menu categories or use search and popular search terms.
2. Open collection/product listings with price, sale price, image, category, and quick add-to-cart action.
3. Select options where variants are required.
4. Add items to cart and proceed to checkout.
5. Sign in/register when needed; use WhatsApp for sales enquiries or support.

## Observed capabilities

- Hierarchical categories and collections
- Search and suggested popular products/keywords
- Product listings, product details, options/variants, regular and sale pricing
- Cart, customer account, product comparison, and regional selector
- Promotional collection banners and featured/best-selling products
- Shipping content for UAE, GCC countries, and international destinations
- WhatsApp, email, address, and customer-service hours
- SEO-oriented product/category content and descriptive image alt text

## Improvements for our implementation

- Build original, mobile-first navigation before adding a very large mega-menu.
- Make technical attributes structured and filterable: brand, voltage, current, size, material, compatibility, and vessel type.
- Add fast faceted search, clear stock status, delivery estimates, SKU/part-number search, and technical documents where available.
- Use clean product URLs, canonical metadata, JSON-LD, sitemap generation, and optimized original images.
- Create an admin workflow for bulk catalog import, variants, inventory, prices, sale schedules, and image management.
- Design checkout around AED initially, with configurable UAE, GCC, and international shipping zones.

## Architecture implications

The first business milestone should be catalog foundations before checkout: categories, brands, products, variants, product images, attributes/specifications, inventory, and SEO slugs. The data model should support option-based variants, sale prices, technical specifications, and multiple shipping destinations.

Authentication remains a separate milestone. For the product domain, roles should at minimum allow an administrator and catalog manager to manage products, prices, inventory, and media.
